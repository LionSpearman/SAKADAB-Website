	Food security is crucial to our partner institution’s sustainability and prosperity. Considering <br>
	the institution is an independent institution, they can only rely on themselves to provide<br>
	their basic needs; the fluctuating nature of donations is not a reliable enough source <br>
	of food/resources on its own. <br><br>
	
	Currently, the institution is using their community business endeavors to sustain their cash <br>
	flow and their food security. In the interview, Miss Marisol, the president of the SAKADAB <br>
	institution had mentioned that each member equally contributes and works in different departments <br>
	depending on their skill sets such as crocheting, sewing, and maintaining a store of their own. <br>
	This shows how the institution’s creativity and resourcefulness amidst the problems they face <br>
	particularly about food scarcity but with factors such as the economic blow the pandemic had on <br>
	any smaller businesses and the institution’s lack of awareness, the institution is in need of some <br>
	assistance. <br><br>
	
	The institution’s method  to manage kitchen waste is currently not known however, based on the most <br>
	commonly used methods here in the Philippines, we can assume that SAKADAB follows the majority in <br>
	depending on the government’s garbage collection service. <br><br>

	According to the National Institute of Health, most communities depend on the government’s garbage <br>
	collection to deal with their waste which majority of the time, ends up in our landfills to rot. <br></p>
	
	<h1><p style = "color: white;"> Converting Kitchen Waste into Valuable Resources </p></h1>
	
	<p style = "color: white; font-size:30px">
	Rice, vegetables, and meat – the most wasted types of food here in the Philippines according to the <br>
	Department of Science and Technology (DOST). But this wasted food is not only another meal not eaten <br>
	but also an opportunity that is wasted. So here are three easy methods to deal with each type of food type. <br><br></p>
	
	<table style="border:1px solid white;border-collapse:collapse;">
<TABLE Border=1 Width="70%" Align="center">
<tr style="color:white">
<th style="border:1px solid white; font-size:30px">Rice Waste</th>
<th style="border:1px solid white;font-size:30px">Vegetable Waste</th>
<th style="border:1px solid white;font-size:30px">Meat Waste</th>
</tr>
<tr style="color:white">
<td style="border:1px solid white; font-size:30px">Rice leftovers can be used and converted into something more valuable 
by using it for another meal. Rice is a very versatile food and is used in a lot of recipes especially here 
in the Philippines – an example of this is turning leftover rice into Adobo rice, effectively making use of 
leftover rice as well as giving one a chance to reuse any leftover vegetable oil as well as seen in this 
recipe by Booky Guide –  <a href = "https://booky.ph/blog/leftover-rice-recipe/">https://booky.ph<br>
/blog/leftover-rice-recipe/</a>.
</td>

<td style="border:1px solid white; font-size:30px">Vegetable waste is probably the most sustainable type of waste and 
the biggest opportunity cost if ever it is thrown away. For vegetables such as potatoes, garlic, and 
lettuce, you can replant the scraps and get a whole new crop, not only lessening vegetable waste but also 
creating a new source of sustainable food – which considering the SAKADAB institution’s money scarcity, this
 can help lessen the burden of food costs in their budgeting.
</td>

<td style="border:1px solid white; font-size:30px">Meat waste can be reused and converted into a valuable product or resource 
in something as simple as feeding the strays. In the SAKADAB institution, they at least had one dog that they 
were taking care of and probably even more strays that pass by and with a dog as big as theirs, it probably 
eats a lot of food. Meat, as our final wasted food can be used instead as the dog’s meal as even though dog 
food might not be particularly expensive, it does add to expenses and by feeding the dog scraps, you can cut 
the pet’s food out of the budgeting of costs.</td>

	 We can turn kitchen waste into a valuable resource by maximizing its usage so that it can become a sustainable source <br>
	 of food and save financial resources as well. The methods we had given prior to this help find a new use for <br>
	 leftover food and make it into new meals that can be reused and made into yet another meal for either the human <br>
	 members of the SAKADAB institution or the animal ones as well. On the other hand, the other method allows them to <br>
	 create their own food and make a sustainable source of food that they can upscale indefinitely the more they <br>
	 consume their own food and are left with more leftovers. In summary, the kitchen waste that otherwise would’ve been <br>
	 thrown out or left to rot is now able to become a sustainable resource that they can use for their own personal <br>
	 consumption by making sure to find a use for every single piece of wasted or unused resources. <br> </p>
